title: Decision Tree from Scratch
language: English
summary: "<p>A decision tree is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms\
  \ due to its ease of interpretation. This algorithm is similar to the way we make\
  \ decisions in our daily life.<br>\r\nIn this project, you will take a closer look\
  \ at the algorithm and write it from scratch with the help of Python, NumPy, and\
  \ Pandas. Teach the model to process categorical and numerical features to make\
  \ data-based decisions. Implement a decision tree for classification and apply it\
  \ to a real dataset.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/259?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
