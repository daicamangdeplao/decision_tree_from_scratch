<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's set up our decision tree classifier. Create the <code class="java">DecisionTree</code> class that includes the functions you've implemented in the previous stages: the Gini and the weighted Gini Impurity, the splitting function for one node, and the recursive splitting function. Don't forget about the <code class="java">__init__()</code> method â€” you'll need it to store the tree's root and a value representing the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node; the default value is <code class="java">1</code>. You also need to implement the <code class="java">fit()</code> method that will allow the model's training. It takes the dataset and calls the recursive splitting function.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">When constructing the <code class="java">DecisionTree</code> class, you may want to separate the methods that are meant for internal use. These methods include the Gini functions, the one-node-split function, and the recursive splitting function. <code class="java">fit()</code> is not on the list since it is used to train a model. There is a convention that a leading single underscore in a Python name of a variable/function/method, e.g.<code class="java"> _gini_impurity()</code>, indicates to a programmer that it is for internal use only.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, build the <code class="java">DecisionTree</code> class based on the tips above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the input path to the file with data;</li>
<li>Read the data from the <em>.csv</em> file;</li>
<li>The <code class="java">Survived</code> column is the target variable. Make sure to separate it from the dataset with features;</li>
<li>Initialize your custom decision tree and train the model on the given dataset.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result of the stage is a set of log messages; they were added to the recursive function in the previous stage.</p>
<p>If you have corrupted CSV file, please <a href="https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/26605/data_stage4.csv" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download</a> and place it in the <em>test</em> directory.</p>
